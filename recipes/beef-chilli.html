    <h2>Description</h2>
    A simple chicken taco recipe that is both filling and healthy.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Chilli</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chilli powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>12 ounces hazy IPA beer</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>
        1 (14.5 ounce) can diced fire-roasted tomatoes with green chillies
      </li>
      <li>2 (16 ounce jars) extra chunky salsa</li>
      <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sliced onions</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high.</li>
      <li>
        When beef begins to sizzle, break up into small pieces with a potato
        masher or spatula. Continue to cook and break up beef until no longer
        pink, about 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chilli powder, black pepper, salt, and cinnammon to the pot. Cook
        stirring for 1 minute, then pour in beer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir, scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pot as you do. Let
        mixture boil until liquid is reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar, oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and jarred salsa. Stir
        in; return mixture to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until chilli is thickened and flavour is developed to your
        liking, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste, asjust the seasoning. Top with sour cream, green onions, cheddar
        cheese, and cilantro as required.
      </li>
    </ol>
